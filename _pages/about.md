I am a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor Scott Shenker in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu/).
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in 2017.

Research experience
======
While an undergraduate, my primary research focus was on serverless computing through the [OpenLambda](https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda) project under Professor [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/).
Our focus was on tackling the problem of high startup latency in serverless environments due to package startup costs, enabling a wider class of applications to be ported to serverless.
To address this, we stripped down Linux isolation mechanisms to the functionality required in the restricted realm of a serverless platform and built a secure Python interpreter cache to mitigate interpreter & package startup costs.
You can read more about the approach in our [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/oakes).

Earlier in my career, I worked in the [Wisconsin Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hci.cs.wisc.edu/) under Professor [Bilge Mutlu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/).
