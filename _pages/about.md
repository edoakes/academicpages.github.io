I am currently a data scientist at comScore labs under Professor [Paul Barford](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~pb/), solving internet-scale measurement and analysis problems. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in May 2017.

Research Experience
======
While an undergraduate, my primary research focus was on serverless computing through the [OpenLambda](https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda) project under Professor [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/).

Earlier in my career, I worked in the [Wisconsin Human-Computer Iteraction Lab](https://hci.cs.wisc.edu/) under Professor [Bilge Mutlu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/).
