I am a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor Scott Shenker in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu/).
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in 2017, where I worked with Professor [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) on serverless computing.
