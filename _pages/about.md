I am a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor Scott Shenker in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu/).
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in 2017, where I worked with Professor [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) on serverless computing.

Prior to graduate school, I spent some time working with the core infrastructure group at Uber. During my stay, I helped make building container images easier and faster with [Makisu](https://eng.uber.com/makisu/) and deploying them feasible at the scale of thousands of microservices with [soon to be open sourced project].

In my free time I like to read, play tennis, and eat any type of new food I can get my hands on.
