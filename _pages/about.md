I am currently working at comScore labs. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate computer science student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/).

Research Experience
======
While an undergraduate, my primary research focus was on serverless computing via the [OpenLambda](https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda) project under Professor [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/).

Earlier in my career, I worked in the [Wisconsin Human-Computer Iteraction Lab](https://hci.cs.wisc.edu/) under Professor [Bilge Mutlu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/).

Work Experience

Do I want this?
